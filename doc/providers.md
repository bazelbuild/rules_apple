# Providers

Defines providers and related types used throughout the rules in this repository.

Most users will not need to use these providers to simply create and build Apple
targets, but if you want to write your own custom rules that interact with these
rules, then you will use these providers to communicate between them.

These providers are part of the public API of the bundling rules. Other rules
that want to propagate information to the bundling rules or that want to
consume the bundling rules as their own inputs should use these to handle the
relevant information that they need.

## AppleBinaryInfo

<pre>
AppleBinaryInfo(<a href="#AppleBinaryInfo-binary">binary</a>, <a href="#AppleBinaryInfo-infoplist">infoplist</a>, <a href="#AppleBinaryInfo-product_type">product_type</a>)

**FIELDS**

                <a href="#AppleBundleInfo-uses_swift">uses_swift</a>)
</pre>


Provides information about an Apple bundle target.

This provider propagates general information about an Apple bundle that is not
specific to any particular bundle type.
It is propagated by most bundling rulesâapplications, extensions, frameworks, test bundles, and so forth.


**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-archive"></a>archive |  <code>File</code>. The archive that contains the built application.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-archive_root"></a>archive_root |  <code>string</code>. The file system path (relative to the workspace root) where the signed bundle was constructed (before archiving). Other rules *should not* depend on this field; it is intended to support IDEs that want to read that path from the provider to avoid unzipping the output archive.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-binary"></a>binary |  <code>File</code>. The binary (executable, dynamic library, etc.) that was bundled. The physical file is identical to the one inside the bundle except that it is always unsigned, so note that it is _not_ a path to the binary inside your output bundle. The primary purpose of this field is to provide a way to access the binary directly at analysis time; for example, for code coverage.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-bundle_extension"></a>bundle_extension |  <code>string</code>. The bundle extension.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-bundle_id"></a>bundle_id |  <code>string</code>. The bundle identifier (i.e., <code>CFBundleIdentifier</code> in <code>Info.plist</code>) of the bundle.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-bundle_name"></a>bundle_name |  <code>string</code>. The name of the bundle, without the extension.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-executable_name"></a>executable_name |  <code>string</code>. The name of the executable that was bundled.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-entitlements"></a>entitlements |  <code>File</code>. Entitlements file used, if any.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-extension_safe"></a>extension_safe |  Boolean. True if the target propagating this provider was compiled and linked with -application-extension, restricting it to extension-safe APIs only.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-infoplist"></a>infoplist |  <code>File</code>. The complete (binary-formatted) <code>Info.plist</code> file for the bundle.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-minimum_deployment_os_version"></a>minimum_deployment_os_version |  <code>string</code>. The minimum deployment OS version (as a dotted version number like "9.0") that this bundle was built to support. This is different from <code>minimum_os_version</code>, which is effective at compile time. Ensure version specific APIs are guarded with <code>available</code> clauses.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-minimum_os_version"></a>minimum_os_version |  <code>string</code>. The minimum OS version (as a dotted version number like "9.0") that this bundle was built to support.    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-platform_type"></a>platform_type |  <code>string</code>. The platform type for the bundle (i.e. <code>ios</code> for iOS bundles).    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-product_type"></a>product_type |  <code>string</code>. The dot-separated product type identifier associated with the bundle (for example, <code>com.apple.product-type.application</code>).    |
| <a id="AppleBundleInfo-uses_swift"></a>uses_swift |  Boolean. True if Swift is used by the target propagating this provider. This does not consider embedded bundles; for example, an Objective-C application containing a Swift extension would have this field set to true for the extension but false for the application.    |


<a id="AppleBundleVersionInfo"></a>

## AppleBundleVersionInfo

<pre>
AppleBundleVersionInfo(<a href="#AppleBundleVersionInfo-version_file">version_file</a>)
</pre>

Provides versioning information for an Apple bundle.

**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="AppleBundleVersionInfo-version_file"></a>version_file |  A <code>File</code> containing JSON-formatted text describing the version number information propagated by the target. It contains two keys: <code>build_version</code>, which corresponds to <code>CFBundleVersion</code>; and <code>short_version_string</code>, which corresponds to <code>CFBundleShortVersionString</code>.    |


<a id="AppleExtraOutputsInfo"></a>

## AppleExtraOutputsInfo

<pre>
AppleExtraOutputsInfo(<a href="#AppleExtraOutputsInfo-files">files</a>)
</pre>


Provides information about extra outputs that should be produced from the build.

This provider propagates supplemental files that should be produced as outputs
even if the bundle they are associated with is not a direct output of the rule.
For example, an application that contains an extension will build both targets
but only the application will be a rule output. However, if dSYM bundles are
also being generated, we do want to produce the dSYMs for *both* application and
extension as outputs of the build, not just the dSYMs of the explicit target
being built (the application).


**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="AppleExtraOutputsInfo-files"></a>files |  <code>depset</code> of <code>File</code>s. These files will be propagated from embedded bundles (such as frameworks and extensions) to the top-level bundle (such as an application) to ensure that they are explicitly produced as outputs of the build.    |

| <a id="AppleFrameworkImportInfo-debug_info_binaries"></a>debug_info_binaries |  Depset of Files that represent framework binaries and dSYM binaries that provide debug info.    |

</pre>


Provider that test targets propagate to be used for IDE integration.

This includes information regarding test source files, transitive include paths,
transitive module maps, and transitive Swift modules. Test source files are

target.


**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="AppleTestInfo-includes"></a>includes |  <code>depset</code> of <code>string</code>s representing transitive include paths which are needed by IDEs to be used for indexing the test sources.    |

Only source files from these deps will be present in <code>sources</code>. This may be used by IDEs to differentiate a test target's transitive module maps from its direct module maps, as including the direct module maps may break indexing for the source files of the immediate deps.    |
