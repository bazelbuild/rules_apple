# Providers

This page describes **providers** that are propagated by the rules in this
repository.

Most users will not need to use these providers to simply create and build Apple
targets, but if you want to write your own custom rules that interact with these
rules, then you will use these providers to communicate between them.

## AppleBundleInfo

This provider propagates general information about an Apple bundle that is not
specific to any particular bundle type. It is propagated by most bundling
rules&mdash;applications, extensions, frameworks, test bundles, and so forth.

<a name="AppleResourceInfo"></a>
## AppleResourceInfo

This provider contains information about resources belonging to a target that
should be included in any bundle that depends on that target. Resources are
files such as asset catalogs, `.strings` files, storyboards and XIBs, or any
other data that should be included in the bundle.

To write a custom rule that includes resources in a bundle, have that rule
return an instance of `AppleResourceInfo` that contains the files you wish to
be bundled. Then create a target using that rule and include it in the `deps` of
the application, extension, or other kind of bundle where you want those
resources to be. (See
[the implementation of `swift_library`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/apple/swift.bzl)
for an example.)

This is a "constructor-like" function that returns a value describing a set of

values to describe the content that should be bundled for a target based on its
resources and the resources from its transitive dependencies.
