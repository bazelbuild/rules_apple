# Setup the Skylib dependency, this is required to use the Starlark unittest
# framework. Since this is only used for rules_apple's tests, we configure it
# here in the WORKSPACE file. This also can't be added to
# `apple_rules_dependencies()` since we need to load the bzl file, so if we
# wanted to load it inside of a macro, it would need to be in a different file
# to begin with.
