    """Macro for calling the apple_verification_test with archive_contents_test.sh.

    List of common environmentals available to use within file paths:
        ARCHIVE_ROOT: The base of the archive that is exapanded for the test.
        BINARY: The path to the primary executable binary.
        BUNDLE_ROOT: The path to the root of the payload for the bundle.
        CONTENT_ROOT: The path for the "Contents" for the bundle.
        RESOURCE_ROOT: The path for the "Resources" for the bundle.

    Args:
        name: Name of generated test target.
        build_type: Type of build for the target. Possible values are `simulator` and `device`.
        target_under_test: The Apple bundle target whose contents are to be verified.
        contains:  Optional, List of paths to test for existance for within the bundle. The string
            will be expanded with bash and can contain environmental variables (e.g. $BUNDLE_ROOT)
        not_contains:  Optional, List of paths to test for non-existance for within the bundle.
            The string will be expanded with bash and can contain env variables (e.g. $BUNDLE_ROOT)
        is_binary_plist:  Optional, List of paths to files to test for a binary plist format. The
            paths are expanded with bash. Test will fail if file doesn't exist.
        is_not_binary_plist:  Optional, List of paths to files to test for the absense of a binary
            plist format. The paths are expanded with bash. Test will fail if file doesn't exist.
        plist_test_file: Optional, The plist file to test with `plist_test_values`(see next Arg).
        plist_test_values: Optional, The key/value pairs to test. Keys are specified in PlistBuddy
            format(e.g. "UIDeviceFamily:1"). The test will fail if the key does not exist or if
            its value doesn't match the specified value. * can be used as a wildcard value.
            See `plist_test_file`(previous Arg) to specify plist file to test.
        asset_catalog_test_file: Optional, The asset catalog file to test (see next two Args).
        asset_catalog_test_contains: Optional, A list of names of assets that should appear in the
            asset catalog specified in `asset_catalog_file`.
        asset_catalog_test_not_contains: Optional, A list of names of assets that should not appear
            in the asset catalog specified in `asset_catalog_file`.
        text_test_file: Optional, The text file to test (see the next Arg).
        text_test_values: Optional, A list of regular expressions that should be tested against
            the contents of `text_test_file`.
        binary_test_file: Optional, The binary file to test (see next three Args).
        binary_test_architecture: Optional, The architecture to use from `binary_test_file` for
            symbol tests (see next two Args).
        binary_contains_symbols: Optional, A list of symbols that should appear in the binary file
            specified in `binary_test_file`.
        binary_not_contains_symbols: Optional, A list of symbols that should not appear in the
            binary file specified in `binary_test_file`.
        **kwargs: Other arguments are passed through to the apple_verification_test rule.
