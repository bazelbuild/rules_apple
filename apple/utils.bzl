  This function examines each file in |files| and looks for a containing
  directory with the given extension. It then returns a dictionary that maps
  the directory names to the files they contain.

  For example, if you had the following files:
    - some/path/foo.images/bar.png
    - some/path/foo.images/baz.png
    - some/path/quux.images/blorp.png

  Then passing the extension "images" to this function would return:

  Note that |files| can be an iterable of either strings (paths) or File
  objects, and the returned dictionary preserves these input values. In other
  words, if it contains strings, then the sets in the dictionary will also
  contain strings (retaining the directory path as well). If the input elements
  are File objects, the returned dictionary values will also be sets of those
  File objects.

  If an input file does not have a containing directory with the given
  extension, the build will fail.

    files: An iterable of File objects or strings representing paths.
