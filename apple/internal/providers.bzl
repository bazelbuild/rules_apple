"""Defines providers and related types used throughout the bundling rules.

These providers are part of the public API of the bundling rules. The symbols are re-exported in
public space to allow for writing rules that can reference the contents of these providers, but the
initialization via each provider's "raw initializer" is gated to the internal rules implementation.

Public initializers must be defined in apple:providers.bzl instead of apple/internal:providers.bzl.
These should build from the raw initializer where possible, but not export it, to allow for a safe
