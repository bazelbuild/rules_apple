A depset of structs with the following fields, which represent transitive Swift sources given module
names and the Swift source files that they belong to.

*   `module_name`: a String representing the module's name.

*   `src_files`: a depset of Files representing source files that belong to the given Swift module.

From the perspective of resource processing, the "direct" module and its sources are assumed to be
sufficiently represented by the current swift_library target, and is not modelled through this
provider.
