    This partial propagates the AppleDynamicFrameworkInfo provider required by
    the linking step. It contains the necessary files and configuration so that
    the framework can be linked against. This is only required for dynamic
    framework bundles.

    Args:
      actions: The actions provider from `ctx.actions`.
      binary_artifact: The linked dynamic framework binary.
      bundle_name: The name of the output bundle.
      cc_configured_features_init: A lambda that is the same as cc_common.configure_features(...)
          without the need for a `ctx`.
      cc_info: The CcInfo provider containing information about the
          targets linked into the dynamic framework.
      cc_toolchain: The C++ toolchain to use.
      disabled_features: List of features to be disabled for C++ actions.
      features: List of features to be enabled for C++ actions.
      rule_label: The label of the target being analyzed.

    Returns:
      A partial that returns the AppleDynamicFrameworkInfo provider used to link
      this framework into the final binary.
