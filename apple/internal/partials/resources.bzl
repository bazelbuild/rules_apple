"""Partial implementations for resource processing.

Resources are procesed according to type, by a series of methods that deal with the specifics for
each resource type. Each of this methods returns a struct, which always have a `files` field
containing resource tuples as described in processor.bzl. Optionally, the structs can also have an
`infoplists` field containing a list of plists that should be merged into the root Info.plist.
