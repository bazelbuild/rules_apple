"""Core resource propagation logic.

Resource are propagated using NewAppleResourceInfo, in which each field (or bucket) contains data
for resources that should be bundled inside top-level Apple bundles (e.g. ios_application).

Each bucket contains a list of tuples with the following schema:

    (parent_dir, swift_module, resource_files)

    - parent_dir: This is the target path relative to the root of the bundle that will embed the
        resource_files. Each of the resource_files will be copied into a directory structure that
        matches parent_dir. If parent_dir is None, the resources will be placed in the root level.
        For structured resources where the relative path to the target must be preserved,
        parent_dir might look like "some/dir/path". For bundles, parent_dir might look like
        "Resource.bundle".
    - swift_module: This is the name of the Swift module, should the resources had been added
        through a swift_library rule. This is needed as some resource types require this value when
        being compiled (e.g. xibs).
    - resource_files: This is a depset of all the files that should be placed under parent_dir.

During propagation, each target will need to merge multiple NewAppleResourceInfo providers coming
from dependencies. Merging will then aggressively minimize the tuples in order to only have one
tuple per parent_dir per swift_module per bucket.

NewAppleResourceInfo also has a `owners` field which contains a map with the short paths of every
resource in the buckets as keys, and a depset of the targets that declare usage as owner of that
resource as values. This dictionary is meant to be used during the deduplication phase, to account
for each usage of the resources in the dependency graph and avoid deduplication if the resource is
used in code higher level bundles. With this, every target is certain that the resource they
reference will be packaged in the same bundle as the code they implement, ensuring that
`[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]]` will always return a bundle containing the requested
resource.

In some cases the value for certain keys in `owners` may be None. This value is used to signal that
the target referencing the resource should not be considered the owner, and that the next target in
the dependency chain that can own resources should set itself as the owner. A good example of this
is is the objc_bundle rule. This rule doesn't contain any code, so the resources represented by
these targets should not be bound to the objc_bundle target, as they should be marked as being owned
by the objc_library or swift_library targets that reference them.

The None values in the `owners` dictionary are then replaced with a default owner in the
`merge_providers` method, which should be called to merge a list of providers into a single
NewAppleResourceInfo provider to be returned as the provider of the target, and to bundle the
resources contained within in the top-level bundling rules.

This file provides methods to easily:
    - collect all resource files from the different rules and their attributes
    - bucketize each of the resources into specific buckets depending on their path
    - minimize the resulting tuples in order to minimize memory usage

    This method takes a list of resources and constructs a tuple object for each, placing it inside
    the correct bucket.

    The parent_dir is calculated from the parent_dir_param object. This object can either be None
    (the default), a string object, or a function object. If a function is provided, it should
    accept only 1 parameter, which will be the File object representing the resource to bucket. This
    mechanism gives us a simpler way to manage multiple use cases. For example, when used to
    bucketize structured resources, the parent_dir_param can be a function that returns the relative
    path to the owning package; or in an objc_library it can be None, signaling that these resources
    should be placed in the root level.

    If no bucket was detected based on the short path for a specific resource, it will be placed
    into the "unprocessed" bucket. Resources in this bucket will not be processed and will be copied
    as is. Once all resources have been placed in buckets, each of the lists will be minimized.

    Finally, it will return a NewAppleResourceInfo provider with the resources bucketed per type.

    Args:

        swift_module: The Swift module name to associate to these resources.
        owner: An optional string that has a unique identifier to the target that should own the

        parent_dir_param: Either a string or a struct used to calculate the value of parent_dir for
            each resource. If it is a struct, it will be considered a partial context, and will be
            invoked with partial.call().
