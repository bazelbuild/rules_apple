This rule takes a single mlmodel file and creates a target that can be added as a dependency from
objc_library or swift_library targets. For Swift, just import like any other objc_library target.
For objc_library, this target generates a header named `<target_name>.h` that can be imported from
within the package where this target resides. For example, if this target's label is
`//my/package:coreml`, you can import the header as `#import "my/package/coreml.h"`.

This rule currently only returns an ObjC interface since the Swift generated files do not have the
necessary public interfaces to export its symbols outside of the module.
