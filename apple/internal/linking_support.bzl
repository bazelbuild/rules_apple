    This function creates a new objc provider that contains the necessary linkopts

    is equivalent to the `ld` flag `-sectcreate segname sectname file`. This can
    be used, for example, to embed entitlements in a simulator executable (since
    they are not applied during code signing).

            outputs, such as linkmaps and dSYM binaries.
