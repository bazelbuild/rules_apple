"""# Providers

Defines providers and related types used throughout the rules in this repository.

Most users will not need to use these providers to simply create and build Apple
targets, but if you want to write your own custom rules that interact with these
rules, then you will use these providers to communicate between them.

These providers are part of the public API of the bundling rules. Other rules
that want to propagate information to the bundling rules or that want to
consume the bundling rules as their own inputs should use these to handle the
relevant information that they need.
