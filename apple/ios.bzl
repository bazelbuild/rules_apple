def ios_application(name, **kwargs):
  """Builds and bundles an iOS application.

  The named target produced by this macro is an IPA file. This macro also
  creates a target named `"{name}.apple_binary"` that represents the linked
  binary executable inside the application bundle.

  Args:
    name: A unique name for the target.
    app_icons: Files that comprise the app icons for the application. Each file
        must have a containing directory named `*.xcassets/*.appiconset` and
        there may be only one such `.appiconset` directory in the list.
    bundle_id: The bundle ID (reverse-DNS path followed by app name) of the
        application.
    dedupe_unbundled_resources: If true, ensures that resources present in
        any frameworks that this application depends on are not also present
        at the main app level. False by default.
    entitlements: The entitlements file required for device builds of this
        application. If absent, the default entitlements from the provisioning
        profile will be used.

        The following variables are substituted: `$(CFBundleIdentifier)` with
        the bundle ID and `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)` with the value of the
        `ApplicationIdentifierPrefix` key from this target's provisioning
        profile.
    extensions: A list of extensions (see `ios_extension`) to include in the
        final application bundle.
    families: A list of device families supported by this application. Valid
        values are `iphone` and `ipad`; at least one must be specified.
    frameworks: A list of framework targets (see `ios_framework`) that this
        application depends on.
    infoplists: A list of `.plist` files that will be merged to form the
        Info.plist that represents the application. At least one file must be
        specified.
    ipa_post_processor: A tool that edits this target's IPA output after it is
        assembled but before it is (optionally) signed. The tool is invoked with
        a single command-line argument that denotes the path to a directory
        containing the unzipped contents of the IPA (that is, the `Payload`
        directory will be present in this directory).

        Any changes made by the tool must be made in this directory, and the
        tool's execution must be hermetic given these inputs to ensure that the
        result can be safely cached.
    launch_images: Files that comprise the launch images for the application.
        Each file must have a containing directory named
        `*.xcassets/*.launchimage` and there may be only one such
        `.launchimage` directory in the list.

        It is recommended that you use a `launch_storyboard` instead if you are
        targeting only iOS 8 and later.
    launch_storyboard: The `.storyboard` or `.xib` file that should be used as
        the launch screen for the application. The provided file will be
        compiled into the appropriate format (`.storyboardc` or `.nib`) and
        placed in the root of the final bundle. The generated file will also be
        registered in the bundle's `Info.plist` under the key
        `UILaunchStoryboardName`.
    linkopts: A list of strings representing extra flags that the underlying
        `apple_binary` target created by this rule should pass to the linker.
    product_type: An optional string denoting a special type of application,
        such as a Messages Application in iOS 10 and higher. See
        `apple_product_type`.
    provisioning_profile: The provisioning profile (`.mobileprovision` file) to
        use when bundling the application. This value is optional (and unused)
        for simulator builds but **required** for device builds.
    settings_bundle: An `objc_bundle` target that contains the files that make
        up the application's settings bundle. These files will be copied into
        the root of the final application bundle in a directory named
        `Settings.bundle`.
    strings: A list of `.strings` files, often localizable.
        These files are converted to binary plists (if they are not already)
        and placed in the root of the final application bundle, unless a file's
        immediate containing directory is named `*.lproj`, in which case it will
        be placed under a directory with the same name in the bundle.
    watch_application: A `watchos_application` target that represents an Apple
        Watch application that should be embedded in the application.
    deps: A list of targets that are passed into the `apple_binary` rule to be
        linked. Any resources, such as asset catalogs, that are referenced by
        those targets will also be transitively included in the final
        application.

        directory containing the unzipped contents of the archive. The only

    strings: A list of files that are plists of strings, often localizable.
        These files are converted to binary plists (if they are not already)

        final extension.
