    """Genrule which provides Apple specific environment and make variables.

    This mirrors the native genrule except that it provides a different set of
    make variables. This rule will only run on a Mac.

    Example of use:

    load("@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple:apple_genrule.bzl", "apple_genrule")

    apple_genrule(
        name = "world",
        outs = ["hi"],
        cmd = "touch $(@)",
    )

    This rule also does location expansion, much like the native genrule.
    For example, $(location hi) may be used to refer to the output in the
    above example.

    The set of make variables that are supported for this rule:

    OUTS: The outs list. If you have only one output file, you can also use $@.
    SRCS: The srcs list (or more precisely, the pathnames of the files
          corresponding to labels in the srcs list). If you have only one source
          file, you can also use $<.
    <: srcs, if it's a single file.
    @: outs, if it's a single file.
    @D: The output directory. If there is only one filename in outs, this expands
        to the directory containing that file. If there are multiple filenames,
        this variable instead expands to the package's root directory in the
        genfiles tree, even if all the generated files belong to the same
        subdirectory.

    The following environment variables are added to the rule action:

    DEVELOPER_DIR: The base developer directory as defined on Apple architectures,
                   most commonly used in invoking Apple tools such as xcrun.

    Args:
      name: The name of the target.
      cmd: The command to run. Subject the variable substitution.
      executable: Boolean. Declare output to be executable. Setting this flag to
        1 means the output is an executable file and can be run using the run
        command. The genrule must produce exactly one output in this case.
      outs: A list of files generated by this rule. If the executable flag is
        set, outs must contain exactly one label.
      **kwargs: Extra args meant to just be the common rules for all rules
        (tags, etc.).
