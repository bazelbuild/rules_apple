def _group_resources(files, groupings):
  """Groups files based on their directory or file extension.

  This function does not directly use the `group_files_by_directory` helper
  function; it is implemented in such a way that it only requires one pass
  through the `files` set, since walking Skylark sets can be slow.

  Args:
    files: The set of `File` objects representing resources that should be
        grouped.
    groupings: A list of strings denoting file or directory extensions by which
        groups should be created. The extensions do not contain the leading
        dot. If a string ends with a slash (such as "xcassets/"), then a
        grouping is created that contains all files under directories with
        that extension, regardless of the individual files' extensions. If a
        string does not end with a slash (such as "xib"), then a grouping is
        created that contains all files with that extension. If a file would
        satisfy two different groupings (for example, a file in an "xcassets/"
        directory that has an extension in the list), then the directory
        grouping takes precedence.
  Returns:
    A dictionary whose keys are the groupings from `groupings` and the values
    are sets of `File` objects that are in that grouping. An additional key,
    `_UNGROUPED`, contains files that did not satisfy any of the groupings. In
    other words, the union of all the sets in the returned dictionary is equal
    to `resources` and the intersection of any two sets is empty.

# A list of tuples describing resource types and how they should be processed.
# Each tuple must contain exactly three elements:
#
# 1. The file or directory extension corresponding to a type of resource.
#    Directory extensions should be indicated with a trailing slash. Extensions
#    should not have a leading dot.
# 2. The "arity" of the function that processes this type of resource. Legal
#    values are `_arity.each`, which means that the function will be called
#    separately for each file in the set; and `_arity.all`, which calls the
#    function only once and passes it the entire set of files.
# 3. The function that should be called for resources of this type.
#
# The function described above takes three arguments:
#
# 1. The Skylark context (`ctx`).
# 2. A `File` object (if arity was `_arity.each`) or a set of `File` objects
#    (if arity was `_arity.all`).
# 3. The resource info struct (as returned by `resource_support.resource_info`)
#    containing additional information about the resources being processed.
#
# It should return the same `struct` described in the return type of the
# `_process_resources` function; the results across all invocations are merged.
#
# NOTE: The order of these entries matters for directory groupings, which
# is why this is expressed as a list instead of a dictionary. This is necessary
# to handle potentially tricky containment relationships properly. For example,
# Core Data models can be versioned (an .xcdatamodeld/ directory containing
# multiple .xcdatamodel/ directories) or unversioned (a standalone
# .xcdatamodel/ directory). In order to make sure that unversioned ones aren't
# processed independently of their parent, the "xcdatamodeld/" entry must
# appear first. The order of file-based groupings is unimportant, because those
# files are always looked up simply by their extension.
#
# Because this is being evaluated at global scope, it must remain *below* any
# of the functions to which it refers, but *above* _process_resources which
# refers to it.
