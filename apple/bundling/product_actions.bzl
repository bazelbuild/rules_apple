    When uploading an archive to Apple, product types that involve stub
    executables need those executables copied into appropriate locations inside
    the archive root. This function creates a ZIP with the correct file structure
    so that it can be propagated up to an application archive for merging.

    Args:
      ctx: The Skylark context.
      stub_binary: The stub binary executable to ZIP.
      stub_descriptor: The stub descriptor.
