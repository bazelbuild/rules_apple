    This action scans the binary associated with the target being built and
    determines which Swift dynamic libraries need to be included in that
    bundle. Some bundle types, like applications, will bundle them in their
    Frameworks directory (as well as an archive-root SwiftSupport directory for
    release builds); others, like extensions, will simply propagate them to the
    host application.

      A `File` object representing the ZIP file containing the Swift dylibs.
