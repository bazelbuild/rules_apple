    """Builds and bundles a tvOS application.

    The named target produced by this macro is an IPA file.

    Args:
      name: The name of the target.
      app_icons: Files that comprise the app icons for the application. Each file
          must have a containing directory named `"*.xcassets/*.appiconset"` and
          there may be only one such `.appiconset` directory in the list.
      bundle_id: The bundle ID (reverse-DNS path followed by app name) of the
          application. If specified, it will override the bundle ID in the plist
          file. If no bundle ID is specified by either this attribute or in the
          plist file, the build will fail.
      entitlements: The entitlements file required for device builds of this
          application. If absent, the default entitlements from the provisioning
          profile will be used. The following variables are substituted:
          `$(CFBundleIdentifier)` with the bundle ID and `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)`
          with the value of the `ApplicationIdentifierPrefix` key from this
          target's provisioning profile (or the default provisioning profile, if
          none is specified).
      entitlements_validation: An `entitlements_validation_mode` to control the
          validation of the requested entitlements against the provisioning
          profile to ensure they are supported.
      extensions: A list of extensions (see `tvos_extension`) to include in the
          final application.
      infoplists: A list of `.plist` files that will be merged to form the
          Info.plist that represents the application. The merge is only at the
          top level of the plist; so sub-dictionaries are not merged.
      ipa_post_processor: A tool that edits this target's IPA output after it is
          assembled but before it is (optionally) signed. The tool is invoked
          with a single positional argument that represents the path to a
          directory containing the unzipped contents of the IPA. The only entry
          in this directory will be the Payload root directory of the IPA. Any
          changes made by the tool must be made in this directory, and the tool's
          execution must be hermetic given these inputs to ensure that the result
          can be safely cached.
      launch_images: Files that comprise the launch images for the application.
          Each file must have a containing directory named
          `"*.xcassets/*.launchimage"` and there may be only one such
          `.launchimage` directory in the list.
      linkopts: A list of strings representing extra flags that the underlying
          `apple_binary` target should pass to the linker.
      provisioning_profile: The provisioning profile (`.mobileprovision` file) to
          use when bundling the application. This is only used for non-simulator
          builds.
      settings_bundle: An `objc_bundle` target that contains the files that make
          up the application's settings bundle. These files will be copied into
          the application in a directory named `Settings.bundle`.
      strings: A list of files that are plists of strings, often localizable.
          These files are converted to binary plists (if they are not already)
          and placed in the bundle root of the final package. If this file's
          immediate containing directory is named `*.lproj`, it will be placed
          under a directory of that name in the final bundle. This allows for
          localizable strings.
      deps: A list of dependencies, such as libraries, that are passed into the
          `apple_binary` rule. Any resources, such as asset catalogs, that are
          defined by these targets will also be transitively included in the
          final application.
