# Travis does not use osx_image when it computes the matrix itself, if we want

# - `BAZEL`: Used in `before_install` to pick the version of bazel to use,
#    "RELEASE" extracts from https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/latest,
#    otherwise it is the tag to fetch.
# - `TARGET` & `BUILD_TARGET`: Are used in the `script` to issue a build
#   `script` phase will be used for an optional `bazel build` and then
#   `bazel test`.
#
# NOTE: The different testing targets are currently split because //test/...
# takes a long time (>25min), and this will allow other things to pass/fail
# independently and provide a shorter log file to look at when things do fail,
# but if getting all to run take too long it might make sense to merge
# things back together, potentially all the way down to just two configs for
# the two different bazel versions.
