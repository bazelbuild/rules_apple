# swift_stdlib_tool copies the required Swift StdLib dylibs for the given
# binaries into the specified output path. This tool will also remove any
# architecture slices which are not used by the given binaries, reducing binary
# size.

# This script only runs on darwin and you must have Xcode installed.
#
# --output_path <path>       - the path to where the dylibs should be placed.
# --platform <platform>      - the target platform, e.g. 'iphoneos'
# --realpath <realpath_path> - the path to the realpath binary used to resolve
#                              symlinks.
# <positional_args>          - any positional argument is considered to be a
#                              path to a binary to be processed for Swift StdLib
